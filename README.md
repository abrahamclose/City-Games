# City-Games
  
  
IMPORTANT: this repo has been recently changed to refelct the changes made at the expo today. I had to immediately move out.
  
  
To run:  
  run the following commands in the SportsCity dir  
    npm init  
    npm i firebase-tools -g  
    firebase serve  
  in your browser  
    open http://localhost:5000/  
      (may be different than 5000 if you have something running at 5000 so pay attention to ouput of prior command)  
    
   
  
  if need access to firebird, send email to amclose@ad.unc.edu. You will be added as an owner to the firestore db.
